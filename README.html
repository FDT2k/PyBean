<h1>PyBean</h1>
<p>PyBean is intended as a proof-of-concept of a Python RedBeanPHP implementation 
(see http://www.redbeanphp.com/ for the original concept).</p>
<p>Beans are simple Python objects with a type that maps to the table name
and properties representing the cells of a row.</p>
<p>PyBean is used in development mode (AKA "frozen=False"), where tables and columns are
created on the fly, or in production mode (the default) where schema will not be altered.</p>
<h2>Quick example</h2>
<pre><code>from pybean import Store, SQLiteWriter
library = Store(SQLiteWriter(":memory:", frozen=False))
book = library.new("book")
book.title = "Boost development with pybean"
book.author = "Charles Xavier"
library.save(book)
for book in library.find("book","author like ?",["Charles Xavier"]):
        print book.title
library.delete(book)
</code></pre>
<h2>Install Pybean</h2>
<p>Pybean is available at PyPi. Just type the following:</p>
<pre><code>pip install pybean
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you want to upgrade:</p>
<pre><code>pip install --upgrade pybean
</code></pre>
<p>Pybean is tested under Python 2.7 but other versions may work.  <br />
</p>
<h2>Creating a Store</h2>
<p>The store is used to save, delete and load beans. You must pass it's constructor a backend,
known as a query writer. Currently, only a SQLite writer is available:</p>
<pre><code>from pybean import Store, SQLiteWriter
# "frozen=False" means the SQLiteWriter won't create tables and columns on the fly
db = Store(SQLiteWriter("/path/to/your/sqlite/database.sqlite", frozen=False))
</code></pre>
<h2>Creating a new bean</h2>
<p>Once you have a store, you can use it to create new beans:</p>
<pre><code> book = db.new("book")
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we just created a new bean of type "book". The table used to store this type of bean will
be named "book" too. Do not use reserved SQL words as this would break Pybean. Right from the start,
a bean has a unique identifier (a python standard UUID object). You may display it like this:</p>
<pre><code>print book.uuid.hex
</code></pre>
<p>You may now start to assign values to fields:</p>
<pre><code>book.title = "Tom Sawyer"
book.author = "Mark Twain"
</code></pre>
<h2>Saving a bean</h2>
<p>Saving a bean is just a matter of using the store's save function:</p>
<pre><code>db.save(book)
</code></pre>
<h2>Finding beans</h2>
<p>Use the store's find method:</p>
<pre><code># find all books
for book in db.find("book"):
    print book.title

# find books where author is Mark Twain
for book in db.find("book","author like ?",["Mark Twain"]):
    print book.author
</code></pre>
<h2>Counting beans</h2>
<p>This is similar to the find method:</p>
<pre><code>number_of_books = db.count("book")
number_of_mark_twain_books = db.count("book", "author like ?", ["Mark Twain"])
</code></pre>
<h2>Deleting beans</h2>
<p>Use the delete method:</p>
<pre><code>db.delete(book)
</code></pre>
